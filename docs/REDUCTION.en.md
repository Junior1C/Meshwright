# Reducing polygons

Meshwright offers three engines behind one **Reduce** panel. All of them target an
**absolute face count**, and all of them report how far the result strays from the original.

## Choosing an engine

| | Best for | Keeps hard edges | Topology | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Smart retopo** (QuadriFlow) | Sculpts, scans, organic shapes, true low-poly | Optional | Rebuilt as clean quads | Slowest |
| **Decimate** (quadric) | Mechanical parts, CAD, anything with flat faces and crisp edges | Yes, best | Preserved | Fast |
| **Uniform** (isotropic) | Noisy scans, meshes with wildly uneven triangle sizes | No | Rebuilt as even triangles | Fast |

**Rule of thumb:** if the model was sculpted or scanned, use *Smart retopo*. If it came from CAD,
use *Decimate*. If triangle sizes are a mess, use *Uniform* first, then decimate.

## Surface deviation

After every reduction Meshwright samples both surfaces and reports:

- **max** — the worst deviation anywhere, in millimetres
- **mean** — the average deviation
- **% of size** — the maximum relative to the model's largest dimension

Under ~1 % is visually indistinguishable on a print. Above ~5 % you are losing detail you may care
about. The number is shown in the panel, the console and the JSON report.

## Worked example

The miniature in the README: **1,994,490 triangles, 23 separate pieces, genus 114, watertight.**

| Target | Engine | Result | Time | Max deviation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50,000 | Smart retopo | 41,198 faces, watertight, 23 pieces | ~90 s | 0.043 mm (4.3 %) |

The readiness score stayed at **94** — identical to the source.

## How Meshwright keeps reduction safe

Remeshers are not obliged to hand back a valid solid, and on complex topology they often do not.
QuadriFlow on this miniature produced 24 holes, 12 non-manifold edges and 6 extra shells on its own.

Meshwright therefore:

1. **Processes each piece separately**, so a multi-part model keeps its parts and each gets a
   proportional share of the face budget.
2. **Skips retopology on small pieces** (under ~4,000 triangles, or a target under 400) — a quad
   field cannot be built cleanly on a 200-triangle gem, so those are decimated instead.
3. **Pre-decimates very dense pieces** before building the quad field. QuadriFlow does not need
   two million input faces to produce 45,000 quads; this roughly halves the time with no loss of accuracy.
4. **Verifies every piece** afterwards. If the source was watertight and the result is not, MeshFix
   repairs it; if that still fails, the piece falls back to the next engine.
5. **Cleans the assembled result** — merges vertices, drops degenerate and duplicate faces, fills
   any remaining small holes, unifies winding.
6. **Measures deviation** and records everything in the JSON report.

A reduction never hands back a worse mesh than it was given. If something is still wrong, the
Diagnostics panel says so immediately — and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> takes you back.

## Going really low-poly

The presets go down to **500 faces**. Below a few hundred, use *Smart retopo* — quadric collapse
produces increasingly ugly slivers at extreme ratios, while a quad field degrades gracefully.
Check the deviation figure: at low-poly targets it is the only honest measure of what you lost.


## Why smart retopology sometimes uses a different engine

QuadriFlow builds a curvature-aligned quad field, and that optimisation either
converges quickly or does not converge at all. Its running time cannot be predicted
from the size of the input: measured on one model, from the same source at different
decimation levels, it took 2 seconds at 20,000 faces, more than four minutes at 32,000
and at 72,000, then 7.5 seconds at 189,000. It can also abort outright — an assertion
failure inside Eigen, which in-process would close the application mid-operation.

So Meshwright runs it in a child process and gives it two minutes per piece. If it
crashes or does not converge, the piece falls through to uniform remeshing or quadric
collapse, which are quick and predictable, and the log says which engine actually did
the work. A result in two minutes beats a maybe-result in ten.

Before QuadriFlow sees a dense piece it is decimated to something it can build a field
on. That used to go straight to MeshLab's topology-preserving collapse, which is
correct and slow — 73 seconds to take five million faces to two hundred thousand.
Splitting it in two is quicker and better: fast-simplification does the bulk in five
seconds but tears the surface, and MeshFix sews it closed in eleven while keeping 96%
of the triangles. End to end on the same model that is 27 seconds instead of 82, and
the finished retopology deviated 4.95% from the original rather than 9.68%. MeshLab
still runs when that chain cannot produce a manifold.
