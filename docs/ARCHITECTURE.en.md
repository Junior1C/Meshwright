## Principles

**One engine, many front ends.** `engine/` never imports a UI framework. Adding a capability to
`MeshService` gives it to the desktop app, the MCP server and Python callers at once.

**Immutable states.** Every accepted result becomes a numbered `_State` holding its mesh, its
analysis and its shells. Undo and redo move between states; nothing else ever moves backwards.
This is why "it reverted my work" cannot happen — a revert is an explicit, undoable operation.

**Measure, do not predict.** Repair stages record a fix only when the diagnostics actually change,
and the report is a fresh analysis of the returned mesh. Reduction reports real sampled deviation.

**Refuse to make things worse.** `_commit` compares before and after; a result with more critical
issues, or with 95 % of the geometry gone, is rejected and the previous state kept. The caller can
pass `force=True` deliberately.

**Crash safety is cheap.** Snapshots are written on a single background thread as compressed `.npz`
next to a journal, so a 2 M-face save never blocks the UI. A clean exit deletes them; an unclean one
leaves them for recovery.

**Say what is happening.** Anything that can take more than a moment opens a job: the service emits
a `start` event carrying the face count and an estimated duration, then a `done` event with the real
elapsed time. The desktop adapter turns those into the bottom-right notifications; the MCP adapter
folds them into the `log` array of the tool result. Estimates come from `estimate_seconds()`, which
is a measured cost-per-million-faces table — deliberately rough, and only ever used to set
expectations, never to decide anything.

## Data flow for one operation

1. Adapter calls e.g. `svc.repair(strict_watertight=True)`.
2. Service validates arguments and takes the lock.
3. The algorithm runs, logging each step (the log reaches the UI console live).
4. `_commit` splits shells, analyses the exact mesh it will keep, and compares with the previous state.
5. Rejected → previous state kept, reason returned. Accepted → new state, snapshot queued, history appended.
6. The result carries the analysis, stats, shells and a compact binary preview.

## Texture coordinates live beside the mesh, not inside it

A UV is a property of a *face corner*, not of a vertex. Two faces meeting along a seam
share a position but need different UVs there, so the usual per-vertex storage forces
that vertex to be duplicated.

That duplication is harmless to a renderer and poisonous to a mesh analyser. A split
vertex breaks the edge that joined two triangles, so a watertight solid with a normal
UV layout reads as a pile of disconnected shells with hundreds of open boundary edges —
and the repair pipeline dutifully closes holes that were never there. Measured on a
clean textured sphere before this was fixed: load reported *Repair required, score 59,
9 shells*; decimating to 25% pushed it to 201 shells; repair then inflated 1,279 faces
into 168,811.

So Meshwright keeps UVs in a separate `(F, 3, 2)` array — one UV per corner of every
face — held on `_State` next to the mesh:

```
_State
├── mesh      welded trimesh: real topology, what analysis and repair see
└── uv        (F, 3, 2) float32, or None
```

**Nothing in the geometry pipeline knows about it.** `mesh_repair`, `mesh_reducer`,
`mesh_cleanup` and `mesh_retopo` take a mesh and return a mesh. `_commit` then carries
the UV channel from the old state onto the new geometry in one place, via
`uv_channel.transfer()`.

`transfer()` projects every corner of the new mesh to its closest point on the *source
surface* — an exact AABB query through `trimesh.proximity` (Rtree), not a
nearest-centroid guess — and reads the UV interpolated there. A corner whose closest
source face sits in a different UV chart from the rest of its own face would drag a
texel from the far side of the atlas, so those are re-evaluated against the chart the
face actually belongs to. Chart membership comes from `chart_labels()`: a connected-
components pass over face adjacency where two neighbours join only if they agree on the
UV at both ends of their shared edge.

Measured drift on a seam-free test surface with an exactly known UV map, in texels on a
2048 px map (the previous scheme in brackets):

| Operation | Mean | Worst |
|---|---|---|
| Decimate to 50% | 0.01 (9.9) | 0.04 (82) |
| Decimate to 10% | 0.03 (29.3) | 0.12 (175) |
| Decimate to 2% | 0.14 (75.9) | 0.46 (394) |
| Repair | 3.33 (12.9) | 23.6 (775) |

Vertices are split into the per-vertex form at exactly two boundaries, and both are
edges of the system rather than parts of it:

- `preview.py` → the GPU vertex buffer. Open-edge overlays are still found on the welded
  mesh and re-pointed at the split buffer through `split_for_gpu`'s `vertex_map`.
- `mesh_exporter.py` / `material_manager.py` → OBJ, glTF and GLB. STL, PLY, OFF and 3MF
  carry no UVs and are written from the welded mesh unchanged.

`unwrap_corner_uv()` follows the same rule: xatlas returns a vertex-split mesh, and its
split is unpacked straight back into a corner array. Unwrapping therefore does not touch
the geometry at all — a print-ready model stays *Print ready, score 100, watertight*
and simply gains texture coordinates.

## Working around xatlas

xatlas is the right unwrapper and there is no pip-installable alternative that
segments and packs charts. Version 0.0.11 also has two failure modes that ordinary
3D-printing models walk straight into. Both were found by measurement here, and both
are worked around by controlling what xatlas is given.

**It crashes on closed surfaces.** On a mesh where every edge has an opposite —
precisely what a watertight, print-ready model is — `createBoundaries` never marks a
boundary vertex, and the convex-hull pass then reads uninitialised data (upstream
[jpcy/xatlas#146](https://github.com/jpcy/xatlas/issues/146)). An 81,920-face
icosphere takes the process down with an access violation. Remove one triangle so the
surface has a boundary and the same mesh unwraps in 0.1 s. Small closed meshes happen
to survive, but they are relying on the same uninitialised read.

**It gives up quietly above about 40,000 faces.** Past that it stops segmenting and
returns one chart covering the whole surface, with no error. Measured total UV area of
1.02–1.57 inside a unit square, where anything above 1.0 is overlap, and a texture
painted on it smears.

So `uv_patches.split_into_patches()` breaks the mesh into groups that are each **open**
and **under a face cap**, and they all go into one atlas so they still pack into a
single texture. A component that is already open and small enough is passed through
whole, so a model xatlas could have handled gains no extra seams.

Then the result is checked rather than trusted:

- `validate()` rejects non-finite values, UVs outside the atlas, and total UV coverage
  above 0.95 — the signature of overlapping charts.
- `texel_spread()` measures how unevenly the texture is stretched, as the ratio between
  the 95th and 5th percentile of per-triangle texel density. 1.0 is perfectly even.

If the layout is invalid, or merely uneven, the patch cap is halved and it is tried
again — up to three times, keeping the most even valid result. This matters because
xatlas's own segmentation is erratic at size: on an 81,920-face sphere the texel spread
was 18.1× at 20,480 faces per patch, 9.1× at 10,240 and 2.2× at 5,120, while a
180,000-face torus was already 1.2× at 22,500. No single constant serves both, so the
system measures instead of guessing.

Measured after this change — every one of these previously crashed or took minutes:

| Model | Faces | Time | Patches | Islands | Texel spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Icosphere | 20,480 | 1.1 s | 2 | 10 | 1.21 |
| Icosphere | 81,920 | 1.1 s | 16 | 16 | 2.20 |
| Icosphere | 327,680 | 2.4 s | 32 | 32 | 1.40 |
| Torus | 180,000 | 2.5 s | 24 | 60 | 1.15 |
| Open surface | 159,048 | 3.9 s | 24 | 24 | 1.26 |

That last row was **121 seconds** when handed to xatlas whole, and with *higher*
distortion (0.79–1.24 against 0.87–1.10).

`_xatlas_worker.py` still runs the whole thing in a child process. The known failure
modes are designed around now, but xatlas is native code and an unknown crash in it
would close the window without a word; one process spawn is cheap insurance. The worker
imports nothing from Meshwright — numpy and xatlas only — so it can be launched by file
path with no `sys.path` setup.

### What the layouts actually measure

`tests/test_uv_unfold.py` rasterises the atlas rather than trusting `validate()`,
which screens on total UV area and so cannot see a small island resting on a big one.
Across spheres, boxes, tori, cylinders, capsules, an open surface, a multi-part model
and the sample models, every layout comes back with **0.000% of used texels claimed
twice**, a round trip of **under 0.2% of model size** at the 99th percentile, and
texel spread between 1.00 and 1.34. Unwrapping leaves vertex positions bit-identical;
it reorders the face table, and the per-corner UVs are reordered with it.

### Two things the unfold does not do

**Chart handedness is not consistent.** Between 11% and 50% of faces come back
reflected — walking the surface anticlockwise from outside walks *clockwise* across
the texture. Authored layouts do not look like this: a Meshy export measures
2,964,400 faces one way round and none the other. It costs nothing while Meshwright
is both writing and sampling through the same coordinates, which is why the round
trip is exact regardless. It costs something the moment a person paints on the
exported UV guide, because lettering on a reflected island comes back mirrored.

The cause is xatlas's packer, which mirrors charts to pack them tighter and offers no
option not to. `ChartOptions.fix_winding` is about face winding inside a chart and
does not address it (measured: it moved a box from 8 reflected faces to 4, and made a
torus worse). Reflecting the charts ourselves afterwards does not work either, because
the packer nests charts into each other's concavities — a reflected chart stays inside
its own bounding box and still collides, measured at 1.9% of texels on a sphere.
Correcting this properly means packing the atlas ourselves and accepting whatever
utilisation a rectangle packer gives up against xatlas's nesting.

**Decimation across a UV seam leaves a few stretched triangles.** When a collapse
merges geometry from two different islands, the new triangle's corners genuinely
belong to different parts of the atlas and no single chart holds all three. Taking a
2.96M-face model to 40,000: **46 faces, 0.115%, holding 0.90% of the UV area**, the
worst at 36× normal texel density. At 200,000 faces it is 287 faces, 0.144%. Two
alternatives were measured and both were worse — clamping the barycentric
extrapolation gives 71 such faces, and searching for the nearest source face inside
the anchor's own chart gives 63. The current code is the best of the three.

## Texture data is fetched, not pushed

Encoding a six-channel 2048px PBR set to base64 costs about 375 ms and 12.8 MB.
That was being paid on *every* operation, because the result of a repair, a reduce,
an undo or even a rotate carried the maps with it. The MCP server was worse: its
`_strip()` dropped the binary preview but not the textures, so one `repair` on a
textured model returned 9.27 MB to an assistant reading through a context window.

So results carry a summary and nothing else:

```
"textures": { "has_textures": true, "has_uv": true,
              "texture_version": 3, "channels": ["albedo", "normal", …] }
```

`MaterialManager.version` is bumped whenever a channel actually changes. The UI
holds the last version it fetched and calls `get_texture_maps()` only when the two
differ; the UV wireframe comes from `get_uv_layout()` when the 2D view opens, keyed
on `state_id`. Measured on the same six-channel set:

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| One operation result | 375 ms · 12.8 MB | **1.4 ms · 0.17 kB** |
| One MCP tool result | 9.27 MB | **under 1 kB** |
| Ten operations in a row | ~3,700 ms | **12 ms** |

The maps still cost 375 ms to encode — but once, when they change, instead of on
every undo.

## Seam gutters

The unwrapper splits models into patches, so there are more seams than a
single-chart layout would have. A texture only covers the triangles of the layout;
the gutters between charts are empty, and GPU filtering and mipmapping blend that
emptiness in as dark fringes along every seam.

`seam_fixer.dilate_map_set()` bleeds the surface colours outward before anything
leaves the app — the exported texture pack and the baked GLB both go through it, and
so does any OBJ/glTF export that carries a material. The UV mask is rasterised once
per texture size and shared across all six channels; it used to be rebuilt per
channel. The maps held in memory are never modified: padding produces copies, so
what the user loaded is what they still have.

## Why loading a dense model is fast

Two things dominate a large load, and both were once far worse than they needed to be.

**Reindex, don't re-project.** Separating a multi-body model renumbers its faces, so
`_prepare()` returns the permutation it applied and `_commit()` reindexes the UV
channel with it. Before, that permutation was thrown away and the channel was rebuilt
by projecting every corner onto the old surface — twenty million closest-point queries
against five million faces, which on the test model ran for over ten minutes to
recover a mapping that was already correct. Re-projection is now reserved for the case
that genuinely needs it: geometry that actually changed.

**Group rows by packing, not by sorting bytes.** Which edges are open, which faces are
duplicates, which corners can be welded — all the same question, and
`numpy.unique(axis=0)` answers it by viewing each row as an opaque block and sorting
those. `engine/indexing.py` packs each row into one 64-bit integer instead, shifting
each column down by its own minimum so only its range costs bits. The result is
identical; where the values will not fit, the original path still runs.

Measured on a 225 MB FBX with 4,984,030 triangles:

| Stage | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Whole load | did not finish | **27 s** |
| Viewport vertex buffer | 5.6 s | **1.8 s** |
| Diagnostics pass | 10.1 s | **7 s** |
| FBX read and weld | 8.4 s | **6 s** |

What remains is honest work: the diagnostics themselves, shell separation, and
serialising the viewport payload — which for this model is 147 MB of base64 (60 MB of
indices, 31 MB of positions, 21 MB of UVs). That payload, not the backend, is the next
thing worth attacking; it wants a viewport level of detail rather than a faster encoder.

## Viewport level of detail

A five-million-triangle model is 147 MB of base64 by the time it reaches the page. So
`preview.py` decimates above a face cap — the *display* only. The mesh, the
diagnostics, every operation and every export use all of it.

Two details make that honest rather than a lie the user has to discover:

- **Decimation is per shell.** The viewport colours separate pieces by walking the
  face array in shell order, so reducing the whole mesh at once would shuffle that
  correspondence. Each shell is reduced on its own and the new per-piece counts go
  back with the payload.
- **The open-edge overlay is dropped while reduced**, because it would be marking
  edges of the simplified copy. The result says so, and the interface says so.

UVs come across through a nearest-vertex lookup rather than an exact replay:
`fast_simplification`'s `replay_simplification` gives an exact mapping but measured
9.6 seconds against 0.7 for a KD-tree query, on a decimation that itself took 4. For a
mesh that exists to be looked at, that trade is the right way round.

## Working around ufbx

FBX is parsed with ufbx rather than trimesh, which cannot open the format at all. That
has a consequence worth stating plainly: **if the ufbx pass does not lift a texture off
the scene, nothing downstream ever will.** The companion-file scan looks for images
*beside* the model, and a file that embeds its artwork leaves none there. A 228 MB Hi3D
export with an 8192×8192 JPEG inside it opened as an untextured grey model for exactly
that reason — the parser only ever read geometry and UVs.

`_load_fbx` now reads the material as well, through ufbx's `pbr` view. ufbx normalises
Phong, Lambert, Arnold, Maya's standard surface and Blender's Principled onto one set
of named slots, so reading `pbr.base_color` and friends is both shorter and far more
reliable than matching FBX property-name strings, which differ per exporter. The `fbx`
view is consulted afterwards for older materials that do not reach the pbr one.

### The scene has to die before anything large is allocated

This is the part that will look arbitrary and must not be tidied away. **Allocating a
large image while the ufbx scene is still referenced corrupts its teardown**, and the
process dies with an access violation the moment the scene is freed — deterministically,
with no Python traceback, in a place unrelated to the cause. Reduced to its smallest
form: decode the embedded 8192² JPEG, return from the function, crash. Copy the bytes
out, release the scene, *then* decode, and it is fine.

So the work is split. `fbx_texture_blobs` walks the materials and returns raw bytes or
file paths — never an image. `_load_fbx` keeps the scene as its own local and hands back
a mesh built from copies, so everything ufbx owns is gone by the time it returns. Only
then does `load_model` call `decode_fbx_textures`. Keeping the scene a local of that one
function is what enforces the ordering; hoisting it back into `load_model` brings the
crash back. `tests/test_fbx_textures.py` asserts the split from both ends.

Releasing the scene earlier also cut peak memory on that model from 2.4 GB to 0.95 GB.

### A stub must not outrank the artwork

The visual built for an FBX is a bare `TextureVisuals` carrying UVs, and its default
material reports a 2×2 image. `extract_embedded_textures` finds that first, so the merge
in `load_model` is `embedded.update(fbx_maps)` and not `setdefault`: a stub arriving
first would keep the real map out, then be discarded further down as a placeholder,
leaving a fully textured model looking as though it had none.

## Working around QuadriFlow

Like xatlas, QuadriFlow is native code that can abort rather than fail — an Eigen
assertion, which in-process ends the application mid-retopology. It runs in a child
process (`engine/_quadriflow_worker.py`) with a two-minute budget per piece, and a
crash or a timeout falls through to the engines that are predictable.

Its cost genuinely is unpredictable: on one model, from the same source at different
decimation levels, 2 s at 20,000 faces, over four minutes at 32,000 and 72,000, then
7.5 s at 189,000. There is no input size that makes it reliable, which is why the
answer is a bounded wait and a good fallback rather than tuning.

## The walking cup

`ui/js/walker.js` hangs off the progress events the engine already emits, so nothing
in the engine knows he exists. `WALKS_FOR` in `ui/js/app.js` picks the two he turns out
for — `load` and `export`, plus `bake_glb`, which is an export by another name. Every
long job emits progress, and hanging him off all of them put him on screen for most of
a session, which makes him scenery rather than a signal; the rest show the progress
toast, which is what you watch when you are waiting on a step rather than on the file.
The gate has to cover the stop as well as the start, or a repair finishing counts down
the load he is actually walking for.

Those operation names are a string contract across the two languages, so a rename in
`service.py` would not break loudly — the cup would just stop turning up, which nobody
would report as a bug. `tests/test_walker_states.py` checks the set against the jobs the
engine really emits.

Two details are worth keeping if it is ever touched. The sprite is an image eight
frames wide translated inside a one-frame window, not a `background-position`
animation: a percentage in `translateX` is a percentage of the element itself, so
`-12.5%` of an eight-frame strip is exactly one frame, while `background-position`
percentages are measured against the difference between the box and the image and
land between frames. And the bob, the lean and the balloon's wobble all run on
different clocks from the walk — overlapping timings that never quite line up are
what make a rubber-hose walk read as drawn rather than as a sprite on rails.

The vertical hop is deliberately *not* one of those clocks. Across the eight drawings
his body rises and falls twice while his feet stay on a single ground line, which the
cutter preserves when it aligns them; a CSS bob on top runs at its own phase, and two
bounces that disagree read as a judder rather than a walk. The layer that used to bob
now only leans.

Duration is derived, never set: `PX_PER_CYCLE` says how much ground two steps cover,
and every journey's length is computed from the distance it has to travel. A fixed
duration means a wider window makes him walk faster while his legs move at the same
rate, which is what skating is.

He has three positions, not two — crossing, walking out, and *resuming*, which is the
walk out reversed into a walk back when a second job starts before he has gone. It
exists so that nothing can ever teleport him: every transition begins from the
transform he is actually on, read back out of the computed style.

The strip is generated from the walk sheet by `scripts/build_walk_frames.py` and is
committed, because Meshwright ships as a ZIP and nobody should have to run a build step
to get the cup. `tests/test_walker_states.py` checks the committed strip against the
frame width the CSS declares, so recutting a sheet at a different size fails loudly
instead of quietly slicing every frame down the middle. If the strip is missing the cup
simply never appears — `walker.js` waits for the image's `load` event before he is
allowed on screen, rather than walking an empty rectangle across the window.

## The preview payload

The viewport never receives an STL. `MeshService.preview` sends raw `Float32` vertices, `Uint32`
faces and `Uint32` boundary-edge pairs, base64-encoded. The browser builds a `BufferGeometry`
directly. A 1.3 M-face model reaches the viewport in a few hundred milliseconds; the previous
STL-and-reparse route took minutes.

Rotation does not send geometry at all: the viewport rotates its own group instantly, the backend
bakes the same matrix, and both sides re-derive the offset from the returned bounds.

## Coordinate spaces

Models are Z-up; the viewport is Y-up. Geometry is rotated −90° about X on load and recentred on
the build plate. Issue locations arrive in model space and are converted the same way, so a
highlight lands exactly on the triangle it describes (verified to 0.0000 mm in tests).

## Testing

The texture layer is verified against ground truth rather than against itself: a bumpy
plane with a UV map that is an exact linear function of position, so the correct answer
for any point is known and any drift is the transfer's own error. Tests assert a budget
in texels, that decimation leaves the mesh welded, that unwrapping does not touch the
geometry, and that `split_for_gpu` round-trips every triangle and UV.

The rest of the suite covers the analysis checks, each repair stage, sliver geometry (including "must never open
a watertight mesh"), retopology quality ("must not return worse topology than the source"), the
safety guard, undo/redo/revert, validation, crash recovery and the adapters.
