Most "mesh repair" tools give you a spinner and a green tick. Meshwright tells you **what is wrong, exactly where it is on the model, what it did about it, and what the result actually measures** — and it never silently throws your work away.

## Why Meshwright

| | Typical repair tool | **Meshwright** |
|---|---|---|
| Diagnosis | "Mesh has errors" | 12 named checks, each with counts **and a clickable location on the model** |
| Repair | One black box | 6 measured stages — each kept **only if it provably helped** |
| Result | "Done ✓" | Before → after table, verified by a **fresh re-analysis** of the repaired mesh |
| Textures | Dropped on import | UVs and PBR maps **survive repair and reduction**, and go back out with the model |
| Dense models | Freezes, or crashes | Viewport draws a simplified copy; **native crashes are contained, never fatal** |
| Mistakes | Overwrites your model | Numbered states, **Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y**, explicit revert |
| Crash | Work lost | Background snapshots, **recovery offered on next start** |
| Reduction | One decimation slider | **QuadriFlow smart retopology**, uniform remesh, or quadric collapse — with measured surface deviation |
| Export | "Here is your STL" | Seven formats, and it **says when the file is not a solid** — the shell that slices with no infill |
| AI-generated rings | An oval nobody can wear | **Measured and corrected to a real finger size**, comfort-fit bore, edges softened |
| Multi-part models | One lump, one set of operations | **Right-click any piece** — move it, thin it, fuse it, drop it, on its own |
| Scene files | Floor and walls welded to your model | **Lists what is in the file and lets you pick**, grouped by your own Blender collections |
| Will it print? | You find out after six hours | **Checked against your actual printer** — 216 machines, resin and filament — before you slice |
| Opening a file | A row of identical Windows icons | Meshwright's **own browser, with a picture of every model** and its triangle count |
| Automation | GUI only | **MCP server** + Python API on the identical engine |

---

## Quick start

1. Install **Python 3.10 or newer** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) —
   tick **"Add python.exe to PATH"** in the installer. Python 3.12 is the version Meshwright is
   tested against.
2. Download Meshwright and **extract the ZIP to a normal folder** such as `C:\Meshwright`
   (running it from inside the ZIP installs into a folder Windows later deletes).
3. Run `install.bat`, then `start.bat`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeekatplayStudio/Meshwright.git
cd Meshwright
install.bat          # or:  .\install.ps1
start.bat            # or:  .\start.ps1
```

No model to hand? Press **Load demo model** on the empty screen — a small broken test object is
built in memory, nothing is downloaded and nothing is written to disk.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/01-empty.png" width="860" alt="Meshwright on first run">
</div>

### What the installer does

It builds an isolated `.venv` next to the program, so nothing on your machine changes. Required
packages all ship ready-made wheels — no compiler needed. The heavier mesh engines are installed
**one at a time** and any that fail are skipped, so a single missing build can never abort the
installation. Whatever is absent is reported, and a method that needs it says so when you choose it
rather than failing quietly — run `.venv\Scripts\python scripts\check_install.py` to see exactly what
your copy has.

---

## What it does

### 1 · Diagnose — 12 checks, every one locatable

Open holes · boundary edges · non-manifold edges · face winding · inside-out normals · degenerate triangles · duplicate faces · duplicate vertices · unused vertices · sliver triangles · separate shells · unusual scale — plus volume, surface area, genus and bounding size.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/02-diagnostics.png" width="900" alt="Diagnostics panel with a readiness score and located issues">
<br><em>Every issue named, counted and graded — with a 0–100 readiness score that tells you at a glance whether the model is ready to slice.</em>
</div>

Click any issue and Meshwright flies the camera to it and marks the exact spots in cyan, with a translucent sphere so even a single bad triangle on a huge model is findable.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/03-locate.png" width="860" alt="Clicking an issue highlights it on the model">
<br><em>Not just counted — located.</em>
</div>

### 2 · Repair — six stages, each one measured

```
Cleanup → Orientation → Hole filling → MeshFix → MeshLab → Manifold3D → Voxel remesh
```

A stage is only recorded as a fix if the diagnostics actually changed. The pipeline repeats until the mesh stops changing, then **re-analyses the result from scratch** — the report you see is measured on the repaired mesh, never predicted.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/04-repaired.png" width="900" alt="Repair report showing what changed">
<br><em>"What was fixed" plus a before → after table. If anything remains, it says so.</em>
</div>

### 3 · Textures and PBR — they survive the trip

Meshwright keeps whatever textures came with your model, and keeps them lined up through everything you do to it.

**It finds them.** Textures baked into the file (GLB, glTF, FBX) are read from the model's own material — including FBX files that embed the image itself, where there is nothing beside the model to find. Textures the file only points at — an OBJ with its `.mtl`, or a folder of PNGs beside the model — are found by name, including the layouts Meshy, Tripo, Sketchfab and Blender export: `model.png`, `*_baseColor`, `*_Normal_OpenGL`, `*_Roughness`, `*_AO`, and packed `*_ORM` / `*_metallicRoughness` maps, which are unpacked into their separate channels. Some generators embed a 2×2 placeholder in the FBX and ship the real 2048px maps as separate files; Meshwright ignores the placeholder and uses the artwork.

**They stay put.** Texture coordinates are held per face corner, beside the mesh rather than inside it, so the geometry stays a properly welded solid while they travel with it. Repairing or decimating a textured model does not turn it into a pile of pieces, and the readiness score reflects the real geometry. Measured drift after decimating to a fiftieth of the original face count: under half a texel on a 2048px map.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/14-reduced-wireframe.png" width="900" alt="A textured model reduced from 2.96 million to 40,000 faces">
<br><em>2,964,400 → 40,000 triangles, 98.7% fewer, maximum surface deviation 0.025 mm — with the PBR material still mapped correctly.</em>
</div>

**Check it against your printer.** Pick your machine in the panel — 216 of them, resin and filament, from Elegoo, Anycubic, Phrozen, Creality, Bambu Lab, Prusa and two dozen other makers — and Meshwright measures whether the detail in the model is something that machine can physically make. A resin printer is limited by its screen (an Elegoo Mars 4 Ultra is 153.4 mm across 8520 pixels, so one pixel is 18 µm); a filament printer is limited by its nozzle. The same model can be perfect on one and hopeless on the other. Anything too fine is listed and can be clicked to light up on the model, and where detail would be lost you are told the size at which none would be. It reports and points — it never changes the model, because what to do about it is your call. Nothing is claimed unless two independent measurements agree: what cannot be confirmed says so, because a printability check that quietly guesses is worse than none.

**Unwrap, generate, paint, bake.** **Unwrap UVs** builds a layout without touching the geometry — a watertight model stays watertight and its score does not move. **Load Image / Generate PBR** derives normal, roughness, metallic, ambient-occlusion and height maps from any photo or texture. **Export Maps** writes every channel plus a transparent UV guide to open as a layer in Photoshop or GIMP; **Reload Maps** picks your edits back up; **Save Baked GLB** writes one self-contained file. Everything Meshwright writes has its seam gutters padded, so textures do not show dark fringes where the islands meet.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/07-uv-2d.png" width="900" alt="The 2D UV island unfold view">
<br><em>The 2D unfold view, with any channel as a backdrop. On a dense model it draws the island outlines rather than a field of specks.</em>
</div>

### 4 · Viewport detail — big models appear straight away

A model with millions of triangles takes a while to draw, so Meshwright shows a simplified copy and says so. Drag the **Detail** slider up for the full mesh, or down to spin it more freely.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/05-detail-lod.png" width="900" alt="Viewport detail notice on a dense model">
<br><em>2,964,400 triangles drawn as 899,999 so it appears immediately — and it tells you, rather than quietly showing you something else.</em>
</div>

This is the picture only. The diagnostics, repair, reduce, retopology and every export always use every triangle in the model — the number in the Geometry panel is the real one.

### 5 · Reduce — smart retopology down to low-poly

Three engines, one absolute face target, presets from **500** to **50k**:

- **Smart retopo** — [QuadriFlow](https://github.com/hjwdzh/QuadriFlow), the quad remesher used inside Blender. Rebuilds the surface as clean, evenly sized, curvature-aligned quads. Best for sculpts, scans and true low-poly.
- **Decimate** — quadric edge collapse. Sharpest; keeps hard edges.
- **Uniform** — isotropic remesh to equal-size triangles, then collapse. Best for noisy scans.

Every reduction reports how far the result strays from the original, in millimetres and as a percentage of model size. No guessing.

> Remeshers can open holes on topologically complex shapes. Meshwright checks the result of every piece and repairs it with MeshFix — or falls back to a different engine — so a reduction never hands back a worse mesh than it was given. QuadriFlow itself runs in a child process on a two-minute budget: it is native code that can abort or stall unpredictably, and neither should ever take your session with it.

### 6 · Separate pieces

Click a disconnected piece in the viewport to select it. **Shift-click** adds or removes pieces from the selection; clicking empty space clears it. Selected pieces turn red and stay synchronized with the list. Use **Remove selected** to delete them. Dragging still orbits the model.

Multi-part models are split, colour-coded and listed with triangle counts and sizes. Tick the ones you don't want — they turn red in the viewport — then remove them. Select all with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/12-pieces.png" width="900" alt="Separate pieces colour-coded and selectable">
</div>

### 7 · Right-click a piece and work on that piece

Multi-part models rarely want the same treatment everywhere. Right-click any piece in the viewport and the menu is built around what is under the cursor — and says which pieces it will act on before you choose anything.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Move…** | A drag handle on the selection. Shift a piece clear of the body, space parts across the plate, release to commit. Escape cancels. |
| **Reduce detail** | Keep 50%, 25% or 10% — of *those pieces only*. A chunky base thins down while the figure above it keeps every triangle. |
| **Merge into one solid** | A boolean union, not a concatenation: two overlapping halves become one watertight body a slicer can fill. Pieces that do not touch say so rather than pretending to join. |
| **Keep only these** / **Remove** | Isolate the parts you want, or drop the ones you don't. |

Right-clicking a piece that is not selected selects it first. Shift-right-click adds to the selection, the same as shift-click — and **Alt+drag rubber-bands a box** over the viewport to catch everything inside it at once, which is what makes a model that split into three hundred pieces workable at all. Everything stays in step with the Separate pieces panel, and every action is a numbered state you can undo.

### 8 · Rings for wax casting

An AI service will give you a ring in a minute. It is almost never wearable: the bore is an oval, the size is whatever the generator felt like, the inside edge is cut square, and the band is thin where metal will not fill. Generic repair closes the holes and hands back a watertight, perfectly unwearable oval.

Open the **Jewellery** card — collapsed by default, because this is a small audience — set the finger size and the minimum wall, and press **Fix this ring**:

```
BEFORE   bore 16.40–17.90 mm · ISO 51.5 / US 5.87 · 33% sharp faces
         "The bore is 1.50 mm out of round. A finger needs a circle; this is an oval."

AFTER    2.4 s · watertight · 0% sharp faces
         Size as printed   ISO 56   · US 7.64
         Size once cast    ISO 54.4 · US 7
```

Meshwright measures; **Blender** does the geometry a triangle mesh cannot. A comfort-fit bore is cut to your size — narrowest in the middle, flaring at the rims — which fixes the circle, the size and the sharp inner edge in one operation. An angle-limited bevel takes the hard corners off and leaves flat faces and engraving alone: on a ring with 0.3 mm grooves, every groove was still 0.300 mm deep afterwards. Voxel rounding, the obvious alternative, blurs that detail away.

Point it at `blender.exe` once with **Find Blender…** and it is remembered. Without Blender, measuring still works and the fix says why it cannot.

It refuses to be confidently wrong: a bore already wider than the size you asked for cannot be rounded by cutting, so it says so and names the smallest size that does come out round; a solid model is refused rather than given an invented finger size; and with shrinkage set, the size as printed and the size once cast are reported separately, because the model on screen is the wax.

Every limit it judges against is published and sourced in [docs/PRD-RINGS.md](docs/PRD-RINGS.md).

### 9 · Open only the parts you want

A file often holds more than the model. A Blender project lit for rendering brings its studio floor, its reflection cards and the rig's controller widgets; a scene exported to GLB brings whatever else was in it. Meshwright used to weld all of it into one mesh, and afterwards there was no separating it again — in one real project the "model" measured 200 × 200 units because a one-face ground plane was fused to a robot that is 5.4 × 2 × 10.

Open such a file now and Meshwright lists what is inside first, grouped by the collections you made:

```
01 • Torso and central mechanisms         15/15
02 • Head, eyes and articulated jaw       15/15
03 • Left limbs — independent             36/36
04 • Right limbs — mirrored geometry      36/36
06 • Controller shapes (hidden in render)  0/3   ← dropped automatically
90 • Studio and cameras                    3/3   ← one click and the floor is gone
```

Only what you keep is welded; everything else stays in the file, untouched. A file holding a single object is opened as before, with nothing asked.

Listing is deliberately cheap, which is what makes asking practical: a Blender project is read in seconds where exporting it takes minutes, and a glTF is read from its own JSON header, so a 426 MB file is listed without touching the 426 MB.

**Nothing is guessed at.** Objects the file itself marks as not-for-render start unticked — a rig's controller widgets say so in the file. Everything else starts ticked, because the project that prompted this names its ground plane *"Studio ground • excluded from model validation"* and carries no flag at all to say so, while a genuine floor tile in a printed diorama would look identical to any rule clever enough to catch it. The grouping does that work instead.

### 10 · Print check — will it actually print?

Choose the printer this model is going to, and Meshwright measures whether the detail in it is something that machine can physically make. **216 machines** are built in — resin and filament, from Elegoo, Anycubic, Phrozen, Creality, Bambu Lab, Prusa and two dozen other makers — and if you have a slicer installed, its machines are offered too, marked *on this PC*. Nozzle, pixel pitch and layer height can all be typed over, because a nozzle is a consumable and you know what is fitted.

The limit is a different number on the two kinds of machine. A resin printer is bounded by its screen — an Elegoo Mars 4 Ultra is 153.4 mm across 8520 pixels, so one pixel is 18 µm and about two of them is the finest thing it can cure. A filament printer is bounded by its nozzle, which cannot lay a line narrower than itself. **The same model can be perfect on one and hopeless on the other**, and now tells you which.

Anything too fine is listed, counted and clickable — it lights up on the model, like any other diagnostic. Where detail would be lost you are told the size at which none would be: *"at 8× this size, about 7.9 mm tall, every detail would survive."* It **reports and points; it never changes the model** — printing it bigger, printing it on the other machine, thickening it or accepting the loss are all valid answers, and which one is right is yours to pick.

**Nothing is claimed unless two independent measurements agree.** Every layer is sliced and drawn at the printer's own resolution, and morphological opening removes precisely what the machine cannot lay down; that measurement needs no normals and no watertight mesh, so it is the one that decides. Separately, a ray is fired into the surface at every face to measure the wall there — with Intel Embree behind it, 336,780 exact measurements in 0.4 s, returning 10.000 mm on a sphere of known thickness 10.000 mm. But it is only right while the surface faces the right way: on one real 694,000-face model with inconsistent winding it read a uniform 0.24 mm wall straight through a solid figure. So it never decides alone. On a mesh whose winding or watertightness is in doubt its findings are withheld and the panel says why, and where the two disagree, that disagreement is itself the finding. A printability check that quietly guesses is worse than none — it sends you to a six-hour print.

### 11 · Open a file and see what it is

Windows draws 3D thumbnails through Microsoft's 3D Viewer, which is no longer part of Windows 11 — so the standard Open dialog shows a row of identical blank icons and a filename to guess from. **Open model** therefore opens Meshwright's own browser instead: highlight a file and it draws the model, and reports the format, size, triangle count, dimensions, whether it carries textures, and roughly how long it will take to open. Pictures fill in beside the rows, so a folder can be read at a glance, and files you opened before are one click away under **Recent**.

Nothing is loaded to make a picture — each file is sampled and lit, so a 249 MB five-million-face STL is drawn in about 0.7 s and a 67 MB GLB in about 0.2 s, against the 7.7 s that opening that GLB actually takes. The Windows dialog is still one click away, and drag-and-drop is unchanged.

### 12 · Nothing is ever lost

Every change creates a **numbered state**.

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> move between states — nothing else moves backwards.
- A change that would **add critical problems** or **discard most of the geometry** is rejected, your previous state is kept, and you are offered "apply anyway".
- Every accepted state is snapshotted to disk in a background thread. If the app dies, the next start offers to **recover** it.
- **Revert to original** is explicit, confirmed, and itself undoable.
- **New** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>) or <kbd>Del</kbd> closes the model and empties the workspace, after a confirmation.

### 13 · Always know what it is doing

Long operations announce themselves before they start — how many faces they are about to process and roughly how long it will take — then show a live timer and progress bar in the bottom-right corner, synchronized with a glowing top-of-viewport progress bar and center-screen loading animations. Loading progress stays active throughout file reading, geometry conversion, and WebGL GPU buffer preparation.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/13-progress.png" width="900" alt="Progress notification during a long operation">
<br><em>No more wondering whether it froze.</em>
</div>

Everything also goes to the activity console with timestamps, and to stdout, so a long run can be followed from the terminal.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/08-console.png" width="900" alt="Activity console showing every backend step with timings">
<br><em>Every backend step, with timings.</em>
</div>

### 14 · Someone to wait with

Opening a model and writing one out are the two waits worth watching, so that is when
a small cup strolls along the bottom of the window — and he leaves when the work is
done. Everything else shows its progress in the corner instead. Click him and he stops
to ask whether you would like to buy Vlad a coffee.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/15-walker.png" width="900" alt="The cup character walking along the bottom of the window, with a speech balloon">
</div>

He is animated from a hand-drawn eight-frame cycle at twelve frames a second, stepped
rather than tweened, and he is timed by his own stride rather than by the clock, so he
covers the ground his feet claim to have covered instead of skating. The hop on each
step is in the drawings themselves; the only thing the code adds is a slow lean on a
different clock, because overlapping timings that never quite line up are what make a
rubber-hose walk read as drawn rather than as a sprite on rails. He keeps walking for
as long as the work takes, and if you start something else while he is on his way out
he turns round from wherever he happens to be standing.

### 15 · Export

STL, OBJ, PLY, OFF, GLB, glTF or 3MF with source-unit scaling (mm / cm / in) and build-plate alignment, plus a **JSON report** of the diagnostics and every operation applied — good for client sign-off or a print-farm audit trail.

OBJ, GLB and glTF carry your UV coordinates and PBR maps out with the model. STL, PLY, OFF and 3MF have no way to store them and are written as geometry only — which is what a slicer wants anyway.

Meshwright checks the mesh as it writes it, and says so on screen when the file **is not a closed solid**: an open surface makes a slicer produce a single-wall shell with no infill, no matter what the slicer settings say. Inside-out models are turned the right way out on the way to the file.


---

## The viewport

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/11-full-detail.png" width="900" alt="The viewport at full detail">
</div>

- **Shading**: Shaded · Clay · Normals · X-ray
- **PBR channels**: full material, or Albedo / Normal / Rough / Metal / AO / Height on their own
- **Detail slider** — how much of a dense model is drawn, without changing it
- **Overlays**: wireframe, red open-edge highlight, build plate
- **XYZ compass** and one-click **Top / Front / Right / Iso / Bottom / Back / Left**
- **Rotation gizmo** — drag rings or step 90°; applies to the exported STL
- Movable key light, resizable panel (remembers its width)

It renders on demand rather than continuously, so an idle window costs the GPU nothing.

## Automation — MCP server & Python API

The desktop app is a thin shell over one engine. The same engine is available to AI assistants, editors and scripts.

```jsonc
// claude_desktop_config.json
{ "mcpServers": {
    "meshwright": { "command": "python", "args": ["D:/path/to/Meshwright/mcp_server.py"] }
} }
```

14 tools — `load_model, analyze, repair, fix_slivers, simplify, retopologize, remove_shells, rotate, undo, redo, revert, states, export_stl, export_report` — plus a `meshwright://report` resource.

```python
from engine.service import MeshService

svc = MeshService()
svc.load("dragon.fbx")                         # UVs and PBR maps come with it
svc.repair()                                   # measured, verified, undoable
svc.retopo(20000, method="quadriflow")         # smart retopology, UVs carried across
svc.export_model("dragon_low.glb", "glb")      # geometry, UVs and material
svc.export_stl("dragon_print_ready.stl")
```

Every input is validated, every call is guarded and undoable. See **[docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md)** and **[docs/API.md](docs/API.md)**.

## Supported formats

Blender projects require an installed Blender. Meshwright finds Blender on PATH or in standard Windows/macOS locations; set `MESHWRIGHT_BLENDER` to its executable for a custom installation. The active scene is imported with modifiers, object transforms, and glTF-compatible materials through a temporary GLB. Source files are left unchanged. Anything Blender would keep out of a render — a rig's controller widgets, objects switched off in the outliner — is left behind, and whatever remains is listed so you can open only the parts you want. Blender coordinates retain their numeric scale; choose the appropriate source units when exporting. The file browser lists Blender projects without generating a thumbnail.

**In** — BLEND · OBJ · FBX · GLB · GLTF · STL · PLY · 3MF · DAE · OFF · 3DS
**Out** — STL (binary) · OBJ · PLY · OFF · GLB · glTF · 3MF · JSON report · PBR texture pack

Textures come in embedded in the file or as companion images beside it, and go back out in OBJ,
GLB and glTF, or as a folder of PNGs with a UV guide for Photoshop.

Models arrive **the right way up**. Meshwright works in Z-up, as every slicer and build plate does,
while glTF and GLB mandate Y-up in their specification and FBX declares its own axis in the file —
so those are turned upright on the way in and turned back on the way out, which means a GLB written
here is Y-up as the format requires and opening it again returns the same model. Formats that record
nothing about orientation (OBJ, PLY, OFF, 3DS) are left exactly as they were saved, because guessing
from the shape of a model would stand some up and lay others down with no way to tell those apart.

Every export is unit-scaled, rested on the build plate, checked for solidity and named
`<original>-GS-<timestamp>-fixed.<ext>`, so it never overwrites what you opened.

Notes worth reading if you work with dense or textured models: **[ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**
explains why texture coordinates live beside the mesh rather than inside it, how the viewport level of
detail keeps its promises, and what Meshwright does about the two native libraries that can crash.

## Troubleshooting

### “Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store”

Windows ships a **placeholder** `python.exe` that only prints that message. It is on `PATH` out of
the box, so it looks like Python is installed when nothing is. Any one of these fixes it:

- Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and tick
  **“Add python.exe to PATH”** in the first screen of the installer. Then open a **new** window and
  run `install.bat` again — an already-open window keeps the old `PATH`.
- Or switch the placeholder off: **Settings → Apps → Advanced app settings → App execution
  aliases**, turn off **python.exe** and **python3.exe**.
- Already have Python somewhere unusual? Point the installer at it:
  `install.bat -Python "C:\Path\to\python.exe"`

`install.bat -Check` lists every interpreter Meshwright can find on the machine, which is the
quickest way to see what is really there.

### “[ERROR] Could not create the virtual environment”

Older versions printed this straight after the message above, because they believed the
placeholder was Python. The current installer tests each interpreter by running it, so this now
means something else — the message says which:

- **The folder cannot be written to.** Move Meshwright out of `Program Files`, out of a
  read-only share, and preferably out of OneDrive, into something like `C:\Meshwright`.
- **The install is running from inside the ZIP.** Extract it first: right-click the ZIP →
  *Extract All…*. Double-clicking `install.bat` inside a ZIP unpacks a copy into a temporary
  folder that Windows deletes later.
- **A half-finished `.venv` is in the way.** Run `install.bat -Recreate`.

### The install ends with “Engines skipped: …”

That is not a failure. Those engines are compiled extensions, and a Python released a few weeks ago
usually has no ready-made build for one or two of them yet. Meshwright runs and reports which
repair or retopology methods are unavailable; installing **Python 3.12** and running
`install.bat -Recreate` gets the complete set.

### Meshwright opened, but there is no model

Meshwright ships no 3D models — nothing to download, no folder to point it at. It works on the
files you already have: **Open model**, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>, or drag a file onto the
window. To try it immediately, click **Load demo model** in the empty viewport; that builds a small
deliberately broken object in memory so you can watch the diagnostics and the repair work.

**Open model** opens Meshwright's own browser rather than the Windows one, because Windows has no
picture of a 3D file to show: it draws 3D thumbnails through Microsoft's 3D Viewer, which Windows 11
no longer includes. Highlight a file and Meshwright draws the model and tells you its format, size,
triangle count, dimensions, whether it carries textures and about how long it will take to open —
without opening it, in a fraction of the time that would take. Files you opened before are under
**Recent**, and **Windows dialog…** still gives you the standard box if you prefer it.

The black terminal window that opens next to it is the activity log. Keep it open — closing it
closes Meshwright.

### The exported STL slices as a thin shell — one layer, no infill

The slicer is right: the file is a **surface**, not a solid. A slicer fills the inside of a closed
volume; an open surface has no inside, so it becomes a single-wall shell however the infill is set.

Meshwright now says this out loud when it writes the file (“Saved, but this is not a printable
solid”), and the diagnostics panel flags it before that — look for **open holes** or
**boundary edges**, and the readiness score will be low. The fix is to press **Repair** and export
again; the panel must say *watertight* for a slicer to treat the model as solid.

Two related cases the export warning also covers:

- **“The model is hollow with walls averaging 0.4 mm.”** The model really is a shell — often a
  scan, or a surface exported from a CAD program with zero thickness. Give it thickness in the
  program it came from, or use the slicer’s vase/spiral mode deliberately.
- **Inside-out models.** Meshwright turns the winding the right way out as it exports, so a mesh
  the slicer used to read as a cavity comes out as a solid.

### Something else

Every install writes `install-log.txt` next to `install.bat`, and
`.venv\Scripts\python scripts\check_install.py` prints exactly which engines your copy has. Those
two outputs are what to attach to a bug report.

## Development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
npm install       # vendors Three.js into ui/vendor and installs eslint

npm test          # pytest, 347 tests
npm run lint      # eslint + ruff
npm run mcp       # start the MCP server
```

Dependency versions in `requirements.txt` are deliberately bounded (`numpy>=1.26,<2.6` and so on) so
an install can never drag a shared environment to an incompatible version. Anything that needs a
compiler belongs in `requirements-optional.txt`, never in `requirements.txt`.

### Building a Windows installer

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements-build.txt
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File packaging\build.ps1
```

That freezes Meshwright into a program that runs with no Python installed, proves it works by running
its own 18-step self-test, and wraps it in `Meshwright-Setup-<version>.exe`. See
[packaging/README.md](packaging/README.md) for the two editions (with and without the GPL-licensed
engines) and how to test an installer without putting anyone's data at risk.
