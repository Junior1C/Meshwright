All notable changes to Meshwright. Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Rings for wax casting.** An image-to-3D service will produce a ring in under a minute, and the
  result looks right in a render and is almost never right on a finger: the bore is an oval, its size
  is whatever the generator felt like, the inside edge is cut square, and the band is thin where
  metal will not fill. Generic repair — including the auto-repair those services now ship — closes
  holes and fixes normals, and will hand back a watertight, manifold, perfectly unwearable oval.

  Meshwright now measures a ring the way a jeweller would and corrects it. Load it, set the finger
  size and the minimum wall, press **Fix this ring**: the mesh is repaired, then handed to Blender
  for a true, correctly sized comfort-fit bore and edges taken off without losing the engraving, and
  comes back as an ordinary undoable state. On a test ring built oval on purpose — bore
  16.40–17.90 mm, ISO 51.5 — that is 2.4 s to a watertight ring at exactly the size asked for.

  **Measuring happens here, and never guesses.** The finger axis is the principal axis carrying the
  largest moment of inertia, which holds whatever angle the file was saved at. The bore is then read
  by firing rays outward from it — reading vertex positions instead aliases badly, and a bore drawn
  with 180 segments reports itself 4 mm out of round when it is nothing of the kind. A ring's size
  is taken at its **narrowest** point, because that is where the finger meets it; averaging an oval
  invents a size the ring does not have, and always a size too large.

  **Correcting happens in Blender**, because two of the operations have no good answer in a triangle
  mesh. Rounding a sharp edge by voxel filtering blurs away the 0.3 mm engraving that casting
  guidelines ask for, and going fine enough to avoid that would take 1.4 billion voxels for one ring.
  Blender's angle-limited bevel rounds the hard corners and leaves flat faces and shallow detail
  alone — measured on a ring with 0.3 mm grooves, every groove was still 0.300 mm deep afterwards.
  The ring is sent standing on +Z and centred, so the script works in known coordinates, and it comes
  back where it was: measured movement, 0.000 mm.

  What it will not do quietly: cutting a bore can only take metal away, so where the generator's bore
  was already wider than the size asked for it stays oval — and the panel says so, with the smallest
  size at which it does come out truly round. A model that is solid through the middle is refused
  rather than handed an invented finger size. And when shrinkage compensation is set, the panel
  reports the size as printed **and** the size once cast, separately, because the model on screen is
  the wax and not the ring.

  Every figure it judges against is published and sourced in `docs/PRD-RINGS.md`: 1.0 mm for a ring
  band, 0.35 mm as the lost-wax floor, ISO 8653 for sizes.

  The card is **collapsed by default** and remembers being opened. This is a small audience, and
  nobody printing miniatures should have ring sizes in their way.

- **Blender's location is now a setting.** A status line and **Find Blender…** in the jewellery
  panel; the path is checked before it is stored, and a configured path beats `MESHWRIGHT_BLENDER`,
  which beats searching. Without Blender the fix is disabled with a reason that says what to do, and
  measuring still works.

- `docs/PRD-RINGS.md` — the research behind all of this: what a wearable ring needs, what the
  casting houses publish, what already exists, and what was measured rather than assumed.


## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added
- **Right-click a piece and work on that piece.** A model made of separate pieces usually needs
  different things done to different parts of it — the figure kept and the base thinned, two halves
  fused into one solid, an arm moved clear of the body before it is printed — and every one of those
  used to go through the panel on the right, which meant finding the piece in a list instead of
  pointing at it.

  Right-clicking now opens a menu built around what is under the cursor: **Move**, **Reduce detail**
  (keep 50%, 25% or 10%), **Merge into one solid**, **Keep only these**, **Remove**, and the
  selection and view commands. The menu names the pieces it will act on at the top, so the scope of
  every entry is stated rather than assumed, and right-clicking a piece that is not selected selects
  it first — acting on something other than the thing you just pointed at is what nobody expects.
  Shift-right-click adds to the selection, the way shift-click already does.

- **Alt+drag rubber-bands a box over the viewport** and selects every piece inside it; holding Shift
  as well adds them to what is already chosen rather than replacing it. Picking pieces one at a time
  is fine for three and hopeless for the three hundred a scan or a generated model routinely splits
  into.

  A piece counts as caught the moment any one of its points lands in the box — the "touch" rule a
  modelling program uses — because a band that demanded a whole piece be enclosed would refuse
  everything on a zoomed-in model, which is when one is most wanted. The search stops at the first
  point found inside each piece, so the usual case costs almost nothing.

  Alt is what keeps the gesture out of the way: a plain drag still orbits and a plain click still
  picks, both of which are used far more often. Releasing over nothing says so rather than silently
  clearing the selection, a band only a few pixels across is treated as a slipped click, and Escape
  abandons one mid-drag.

- **A drag handle for moving pieces.** **Move** puts a translate gizmo on the selection; dragging
  shifts those pieces in the viewport and releasing commits the move. The viewport holds one mesh
  rather than one object per piece, so this shifts the vertices that piece's faces use — safe
  precisely because a piece is a connected component and shares no vertex with any other. The
  vertex list is worked out once when the drag begins rather than per frame, which on a
  half-million-face model is the difference between dragging and watching a slideshow. Escape
  cancels and puts the model back as it was.

- **Merging is a boolean union, not a concatenation.** Two halves that overlap come out as a single
  watertight body a slicer can fill. Pieces that do not touch cannot be fused by any amount of
  arithmetic, and the result says how many separate bodies are left rather than implying a join that
  is not there.

- **Reducing one piece leaves the others at full detail**, which is what makes it useful for a base
  or a support block under a figure that must keep every triangle it has.

  A translation changes no topology, so a moved piece keeps the texture coordinates it had instead
  of having them re-projected onto geometry that has just been dragged somewhere else.


### Added
- **A file with more than one object in it now asks which ones you want.** Meshwright has always
  opened a model by welding every object in the file into one mesh — right for a figure saved on its
  own, wrong for anything that was set up for rendering. A Blender project arrives with its studio
  floor and its reflection cards fused to the model, and no amount of work afterwards can separate
  them again.

  Opening such a file now lists what is in it first — name, triangle count and size, grouped by the
  collections the author made — and only what you keep is welded. In one real project that is 108
  objects in six groups, and the studio goes away in a single click.

  Listing is deliberately cheap, which is what makes asking practical: a Blender project is read in
  under two seconds where exporting it takes minutes, and a glTF is read from its own header, so a
  426 MB file is listed without touching the 426 MB.

  **Nothing is guessed at.** Objects the file itself marks as not-for-render start unticked — a rig's
  controller widgets say so in the file — and everything else starts ticked. That restraint is the
  point: the project that prompted this names its 200 x 200 ground plane "Studio ground - excluded
  from model validation" and carries no flag at all to say so, while a genuine floor tile in a
  printed diorama would look identical to any rule that tried to be clever. The grouping does the
  work instead.

  A file that holds one object is opened as before, with no question asked. A choice that cannot be
  honoured now fails and says so, rather than falling through to a loader that cannot filter and
  quietly handing back the whole scene — which would have been the one failure nobody would notice.

### Changed
- **Blender projects no longer import what Blender itself would not render.** The export now passes
  `use_visible` and `use_renderable`, so a rig's controller widgets and anything switched off in the
  outliner stay behind. This is the half of the problem the file answers on its own; the other half
  is the picker above.


## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- Import Blender `.blend` projects through an installed Blender, detected automatically or configured with `MESHWRIGHT_BLENDER`. Imports the active scene through a temporary GLB with modifiers, transforms, UVs, and compatible materials; leaves the source project unchanged.
- Select disconnected pieces directly in the viewport. Click selects one piece, Shift-click adds or removes it, and clicking empty space clears the selection. Red highlights and the Separate pieces list stay synchronized with the existing removal controls.
- Tests covering Blender round-trip import, import failures, viewport ray picking, selection toggling, and gesture handling.

### Fixed
- Preserve piece highlights when changing viewport detail.
- Synchronize application and npm package versions.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- **Meshwright checks a model against the printer it is going to.** Pick your machine from the
  panel — 216 of them, resin and filament, from Elegoo, Anycubic, Phrozen, Creality, Bambu Lab,
  Prusa and two dozen other makers — and Meshwright measures whether the detail in the model is
  something that machine can physically make. What is too fine is listed, counted, and can be
  clicked to light up on the model. Nozzle, pixel pitch and layer height can all be overridden,
  because a nozzle is a consumable and the owner knows what is fitted.

  It **reports and points; it never changes the model.** What to do about a detail that is too fine
  has more than one right answer — print it bigger, print it on the other machine, thicken it, or
  accept the loss — and that is the owner's call. Where detail would be lost, it works out the size
  at which nothing would be, and says so in millimetres as well as in multiples ("at 8× this size,
  about 7.9 mm tall, every detail would survive"), which matters because most generated models
  arrive saved at about a millimetre tall.

  The two numbers that decide are not the same on the two kinds of machine. A resin printer is
  limited by its screen — an Elegoo Mars 4 Ultra is 153.4 mm across 8520 pixels, so one pixel is
  18 µm and about two of them is the finest thing it can cure. A filament printer is limited by its
  nozzle, which cannot lay a line narrower than itself. The same model can therefore be perfect on
  one and hopeless on the other, and now says which.

  **Nothing is asserted unless two independent measurements agree.** Each layer is sliced and drawn
  at the printer's own resolution, and morphological opening removes exactly what the machine cannot
  lay down — that measurement needs no surface normals and no watertight mesh, so it decides.
  Separately, a ray is fired into the surface at every face to measure the wall there; with Intel
  Embree behind it that is 336,780 exact measurements in 0.4 s, and on a sphere of known thickness
  10.000 mm it returns 10.000. But it is only correct while the surface faces the right way, and on
  one real 694,000-face model with inconsistent winding it read a uniform 0.24 mm wall through a
  solid figure. So it is never allowed to decide anything alone: on a mesh whose winding or
  watertightness is in doubt its findings are withheld and the panel says why, and where the two
  measurements disagree that disagreement is itself reported. A check that quietly guesses is worse
  than none — it sends someone to a six-hour print.

  The table is embedded, so it works on a PC with no slicer installed; where one *is* installed its
  machines are offered too, read from its own configuration, because those are the printers that
  person actually owns. Every figure in the table is a published specification, and any of them can
  be typed over for a machine that is not listed.

- **Meshwright browses for its own models, and shows you what they are.** **Open model** no longer
  hands you the Windows dialog, where every 3D file is the same blank icon and the only clue is the
  filename. It opens Meshwright's own browser: highlight a file and it draws the model, and reports
  the format, size, triangle count, dimensions, whether it carries textures, and roughly how long it
  will take to open. Pictures also fill in beside the rows, so a folder can be read at a glance, and
  the files you opened before are one click away under **Recent**.

  Windows cannot do this itself. It draws 3D thumbnails through Microsoft's 3D Viewer, which is not
  part of Windows 11 any more; on a normal machine nothing is registered to preview STL, GLB, glTF,
  PLY, 3MF or OFF, which is why the standard Open box shows a row of identical icons.

  Nothing is loaded to make a picture. Each file is sampled — at most a few hundred thousand
  triangles read straight out of it — and the sample is splatted into a small depth-and-normal image
  and lit, so the cost follows the sample rather than the model: a 249 MB, five-million-face STL is
  drawn in about 0.7 s and a 67 MB GLB in about 0.2 s, against the 7.7 s that actually opening that
  GLB takes. Pictures are kept in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Meshwright\previews`, so a folder is instant the
  second time, and the file's own thumbnail is used when it has one, as slicer-written 3MFs do.

  Numbers are the file's own, or they are marked: an STL's dimensions come from every triangle in
  it, a glTF's from what it declares, and where a file is too large to measure exactly the size is
  shown with a `≈`. Formats that cannot be sampled cheaply — FBX above 64 MB, COLLADA, 3DS, a very
  large 3MF — report their facts and say the picture comes once the model is open.

  It is meant to survive what a real disk holds. A damaged file is explained rather than drawn, and
  a file that claims more data than it contains is refused instead of read: nothing is
  memory-mapped, because walking off the end of a mapped file ends the process rather than raising.
  A folder Windows will not open says so, and is not reported as deleted; a file kept in the cloud
  by OneDrive is left alone rather than quietly downloaded; drives are read from the list Windows
  already holds, so a disconnected network drive cannot stall the dialog. Drawing pictures in the
  background always gives way to whatever you are waiting for, so navigation stays immediate.

  The Windows dialog is still one click away, drag-and-drop is unchanged, and
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> opens the new browser.
- **A real Windows program and installer.** `packaging\build.ps1` freezes Meshwright into
  `Meshwright.exe` (PyInstaller) and wraps it in `Meshwright-Setup-<version>.exe` (Inno Setup), so a
  PC needs no Python, no `install.bat` and no terminal. It installs per user with no administrator
  prompt, adds Start-menu and desktop shortcuts and a proper uninstaller, and installs Microsoft's
  WebView2 runtime only if it is missing. See `packaging/README.md`.

  The build proves the result before it ships one. The frozen program carries a `--selftest` that
  runs 20 checks — the window stack, both helper processes, every mesh engine, texture processing,
  the file browser's previews, the printer check, three export formats and the MCP server — and `build.ps1` runs it
  with nothing but Windows on `PATH`, failing the build if anything is wrong. Each step asserts *which* engine did the work,
  because a packaging failure is quiet: a helper that cannot start does not raise, retopology just
  uses another engine and returns a perfectly good-looking mesh.

  Two editions: **full**, and **lite**, which leaves out PyMeshLab and pymeshfix (both GPL-3) for
  anyone who would rather not distribute those. A `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` is generated from what
  was actually bundled, with each licence's text, because MIT and BSD licences require it to travel
  with a binary.
- `Meshwright.exe --mcp` runs the MCP server from the installed program, and `--version` and
  `--selftest` are available from the command line.
- **A missing WebView2 runtime is now explained.** pywebview does not fail when the runtime is
  absent: it silently falls back to Internet Explorer's engine, which cannot run the interface, and
  the person gets a broken blank window and no message. The program now asks pywebview which
  renderer it chose before opening anything and, if it is the fallback, says what is missing and
  offers to open the download page. A failed start-up is likewise written to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Meshwright\startup-error.txt` and shown in a dialog rather than vanishing, since
  a windowed program has no console to print to.
- **Reliable model loading progress and global visual feedback.** Selecting or dropping a file now
  immediately activates loading feedback on the client side, rather than waiting for an engine roundtrip.
  A glowing amber-to-cyan progress bar pinned to the top of the 3D viewport animates in synchronization
  with background jobs, accompanied by an animated loading spinner and active status prompt in the
  empty workspace. The Python-to-WebView bridge dispatches UI events through a dedicated non-blocking
  background queue, eliminating WebView2 semaphore deadlocks and dropped events.
- **Continuous 2D UV island boundary contours.** The 2D UV Island Unfold viewer now extracts true
  closed 2D boundary loops directly in UV space, rendering crisp continuous outlines against active
  PBR texture channels rather than disjoint floating specks.
- **A cup who waits with you.** Opening a model or writing one out sends a hand-drawn cup strolling
  along the bottom of the window; he leaves when the work is done. Repairs, reductions, unwraps and
  previews keep their progress toast and nothing more — he is on screen for the waits that are about
  the file itself, because a character who turns out for everything is scenery rather than a signal.
  Click him and he stops, under a speech balloon, to ask whether you would like to buy Vlad a coffee.

  He is animated from an eight-frame walk sheet cut by `scripts/build_walk_frames.py`, which lifts
  the background without hollowing out a character drawn in white, checks the cycle order against
  the drawing, and lines every pose up on the ground so he walks rather than skates. The order is
  read from how the body rises and falls — a walk bounces once per step, twice over eight drawings —
  because foot positions do not survive measurement: the lifted foot is clear of the ground, so a
  band across the bottom of a pose finds one foot rather than two.

  He is drawn in colour on a transparent sheet, walks at twelve frames a second, and is timed by
  his stride rather than by the clock — `PX_PER_CYCLE` sets how much ground two steps cover and
  every journey's duration is derived from the distance, so he does not skate on a wide window. He
  keeps walking for as long as the work takes rather than stopping off-screen after one crossing,
  and a job that starts while he is walking out turns him round from where he stands instead of
  snapping him back to the far edge. The speech balloon closes on a click elsewhere, on `Esc`, or
  by itself after seven seconds, and he carries on walking when it does.

  The hop on each step is in the drawings, not the stylesheet: the cutter aligns every pose on the
  feet, which keeps the 35px of rise and fall the artist drew while planting him on one ground
  line. A CSS bob on top runs at its own phase, and two bounces that disagree read as a judder — so
  the layer that used to bob now only leans.

### Changed
- The version number now lives in one file, `engine/version.py`. The About panel, the MCP server
  (which had been reporting `1.0.0`) and the installer all read it.

### Fixed
- **Models from glTF, GLB and FBX arrived lying on their back.** Meshwright works in Z-up, as every
  slicer and build plate does, but glTF and GLB *mandate* Y-up in their specification and FBX writes
  its own answer into the file — and nothing was reading either. A figure generated in ComfyUI or
  Meshy therefore came in a quarter turn onto its back and stayed that way: its height was reported
  as its depth, "Unusual scale" measured the wrong side, and "Rest on build plate" stood it on its
  shoulder. It is now turned upright on the way in, and turned back on the way out, so a GLB written
  by Meshwright is Y-up as the format requires and opening it again returns the same model rather
  than one rotated a further quarter turn.

  Only files that *say* which way is up are touched: glTF and GLB always, FBX according to its own
  header, as read by ufbx. OBJ, PLY, OFF and 3DS record nothing about orientation, and guessing from
  the shape of a model would stand some up and lay others down with no way to tell those cases
  apart, so they are left exactly as they are — as are STL and 3MF, which are printing formats and
  Z-up already. The file browser's previews follow the same rule from the same place
  (`engine/axes.py`), so a picture is a promise about how the model will actually open.
- **Decimate and Uniform failed with "Retopology made no change" when MeshLab was missing.** PyMeshLab
  is optional — the installer carries on without it if it will not install, and the lite edition leaves
  it out — but nothing told the interface, so choosing either method produced a message that named
  nothing and suggested nothing. They now say that MeshLab is needed, which copy of Meshwright lacks
  it, and to use Smart retopology instead. The README had claimed absent engines are "simply not
  offered"; that was not true and now reads as it is.
- **The last-resort repair moved and rescaled the model.** When every other engine has failed, repair
  rebuilds the surface from a solid voxel grid ("Force watertight", on by default). trimesh returns
  that surface in *voxel index space*, and the result was used as it stood: a 40 mm sphere came back
  151 units across and centred on (75, 75, 75). It went unnoticed because the only check was that the
  result was watertight, tried on a one-unit mesh at the origin where the two spaces almost coincide,
  and because MeshFix nearly always got there first. The result is now mapped back through the grid's
  own transform, and one that still does not line up with the model is refused, so a repair keeps the
  mesh it had rather than return one in the wrong place. Found while measuring what the edition
  without MeshFix costs, where this stage is the main path.
- **Textures scrambled across half the model, and a load that could run out of memory.**
  Both showed up on the same AI-generated GLB — 694,078 faces in 366 loose shells, with a UV atlas
  made of 13,314 islands — and they were unrelated.

  Separating a model into shells renumbers its faces, and the UV channel is meant to be permuted to
  match. It never was: the check for "the faces did not move" was tested first, and it only compares
  *how many* faces there are, which separation does not change. So the permutation branch below it
  was unreachable and every shell was painted with some other shell's artwork. 50.8% of faces on the
  reported model, which is why half of it looked shattered. Single-shell models were unaffected,
  which is why it went unnoticed.

  The viewport's simplified copy had its own version of the same fault. Texture coordinates rode
  through the decimation as one UV per welded vertex, chosen arbitrarily from the corners meeting
  there — but a vertex on a UV seam has several, and on an island-heavy atlas that is 45% of them.
  The display copy now carries UVs per face corner, transferred after decimation and split at seams
  exactly as the full-detail path already did. Wrong faces went from 90.8% to 1.8%, and it costs
  about half a second: the transfer picks each face's island by true surface distance over a short
  candidate list, rather than by nearest triangle centroid.

  Separately, the loader parks the model's images on `mesh.metadata` for the texture engine to pick
  up, and left them there. `mesh.copy()` and `mesh.submesh()` deep-copy that dictionary, so a model
  with 4096px maps cloned them once per shell and died with a `MemoryError` before drawing anything.
  Ownership now transfers properly and the images are dropped from the metadata once bound.

- **Loading progress bar disappeared before the 3D model was visible on screen.** Python previously
  emitted `state: 'done'` before returning the model data across the desktop IPC bridge. The frontend
  dismissed the toast and progress bar immediately, leaving several seconds of heavy base64 decoding
  and WebGL geometry buffer upload with zero visual indication that work was continuing. The progress bar
  is now held through the Three.js rendering stage and dismisses only when the model is rendered.
- **Unwrapping UVs removed loaded textures from the 3D model.** Generating or adjusting a UV unwrap
  previously cleared all active materials (`self.materials.clear()`), wiping out albedo, normal and
  roughness maps and resetting the viewport to plain plastic. Textures are now preserved across unwraps
  and remain mapped onto the surface and displayed in the 2D unfold view.
- **An FBX with its texture baked inside loaded as a grey model, or crashed the program.** Three
  faults in a row on the same file, a 228 MB Hi3D export carrying an 8192×8192 JPEG:

  The FBX parser only ever read geometry and UVs, so the material — and the artwork inside it — was
  never looked at. Nothing downstream could recover it either: trimesh cannot open FBX at all, and
  the companion-file scan looks for images *beside* the model, which a file that embeds its own has
  none of. Textures are now read from the material, through the normalised view that covers Phong,
  Lambert, Arnold, Maya and Blender-style materials alike, embedded or referenced by name.

  Decoding them then took the whole program down without a message. Allocating a large image while
  the FBX scene is still open corrupts its teardown, and the process dies the moment it is released.
  The bytes are now copied out and the scene closed before anything is decoded — which also cut peak
  memory on that model from 2.4 GB to 0.95 GB.

  Finally, a model in more than one piece never showed its texture. The piece-colour overlay paints
  straight onto the mesh, and the viewport will not fight it — so with 49 pieces the map was loaded,
  the UVs were there, the button said PBR, and the model still drew flat grey. A textured model now
  opens showing its texture, and choosing any shading mode takes the overlay down instead of lighting
  the button up and changing nothing. **Highlight** puts the piece colours back.

- **A reduced model showed a wrong colour on a handful of triangles near its seams.** Carrying UVs
  through an edit rebuilds some corners from a neighbouring triangle, which extends that triangle's
  plane and can land a hair past the edge of the texture sheet — measured 0.0077 outside on 108 of
  119,994 corners taking a 2.96M-face model down to 40,000. The viewer samples with repeat wrapping,
  so a hair past the edge fetches a colour from the opposite side of the atlas, on about a hundred
  faces. The transfer now holds its answer inside the range the source itself used, which leaves a
  deliberately tiled layout untouched.

- **Loading a model could fail outright with `IndexError: boolean index did not match indexed
  array`.** The two passes that drop degenerate and duplicate faces built both of their masks up
  front. The first pass shortens the face array, so the second mask was then too long by exactly
  the number of faces the first had removed, and any model with both kinds of bad face refused to
  open. Each mask is now measured against the faces that are actually there when it is applied.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- **Textured models were diagnosed as broken, and repair then destroyed them.** UV coordinates were
  stored per vertex, which forces a vertex to be duplicated at every texture seam. That duplication
  breaks the edge joining two triangles, so the analyser read a clean watertight model as a pile of
  disconnected shells with hundreds of open holes — and repair closed holes that were never there.
  A clean textured sphere GLB loaded as *Repair required, score 59, 9 shells*; decimating it to 25%
  produced 201 shells; repair then turned 1,279 faces into 168,811. Meshwright now keeps texture
  coordinates in a per-face-corner array beside the mesh, so the geometry stays welded and analysis,
  repair and reduction all see the real topology. The same model now loads and survives the whole
  pipeline as *Print ready, score 100, watertight, 0 shells*.
- **Reducing or repairing a textured model slid the texture across the surface.** UVs were carried
  over by matching each new triangle to the source triangle with the nearest *centroid*, then
  projecting all three of its corners onto that one triangle and clamping anything that fell
  outside — which snapped those corners onto the triangle's edge. Every corner is now projected to
  its true closest point on the source surface, and corners that land across a UV seam are
  re-evaluated inside the chart their own face belongs to. Measured against a known-exact UV map,
  worst-case drift after decimating to 2% of the original face count fell from 394 texels to 0.46
  on a 2048 px map; after repair, from 775 to 24.
- **Decimation left the mesh as an unwelded triangle soup.** The old UV transfer computed every face
  corner independently and could weld almost none of them back together, so a 1,280-face result came
  back with 3,785 vertices instead of 642 — losing smooth shading, inflating exports and breaking
  watertightness. Decimation now returns a properly welded mesh.
- **Unwrapping a print-ready model reported it as broken.** Unwrap split vertices at every seam, so a
  model scoring 100 dropped to 59 with "7 open holes" without a single triangle changing. Unwrapping
  no longer touches the geometry.
- **Unwrapping crashed the whole application on ordinary watertight models.** xatlas has a bug on
  closed surfaces — where every edge has an opposite, which is exactly what a print-ready model is —
  that leaves its boundary data unset and its convex-hull pass reading uninitialised memory
  ([jpcy/xatlas#146](https://github.com/jpcy/xatlas/issues/146)). An 81,920-face sphere took the
  window down with an access violation and no message. Meshwright now splits every model into open
  patches before unwrapping, so xatlas is never given the input that breaks it, and the patches are
  packed into one atlas so the result is still a single texture layout. The same sphere now unwraps
  in about a second.
- **Unwrapping large models silently produced overlapping UVs.** Above roughly 40,000 faces xatlas
  stops segmenting and returns one chart covering the whole surface, with no error — measured UV
  coverage of 1.02 to 1.57 in a unit square, where anything above 1.0 means charts sitting on top of
  each other and a texture that smears. Every layout is now measured before it is accepted, and the
  patches are halved and retried if it overlaps or if the texture density came out uneven.
- **Unwrapping was extremely slow on dense models.** A 159,048-face surface took 121 seconds; it now
  takes 3.9, with *lower* distortion. A 327,680-face model went from crashing to 2.4 seconds.
- **Re-unwrapping a textured model silently scrambled it.** A new UV layout invalidates any texture
  painted for the old one. Unwrap now asks first, and clears maps that no longer apply.
- **A stray image file beat the texture the model actually declared.** Companion-file scanning ran
  before the model's own material, so a leftover `*_diffuse.png` in the folder overrode the embedded
  base colour. The material a file declares is now the authority; the folder scan fills the gaps.
- **`metallicRoughness` texture files were ignored.** The standard glTF export name — what Sketchfab,
  Blender and most exporters write — matched no pattern, so metallic and roughness were silently
  lost, and with no separate base-colour file the packed map could be loaded as albedo. It is now
  recognised and unpacked, alongside `metalRough`, `RMA` and `occlusionRoughnessMetallic`.
- **`dilation_pixels=` was ignored by the seam dilator.** Every caller silently got the 16 px default,
  including the ComfyUI node and the project's own test.
- **Every successful UV unwrap reported an error.** A button reference was scoped to the wrong
  function, so the handler threw before its success message.
- **The UV island count was the mesh body count.** A sphere unwrapped into 7 charts reported "1
  island". The real chart count now comes from xatlas, along with the atlas size.
- **A recovered crash session inherited the previous model's textures.** `recover()` did not clear the
  material set the way `load()` does.
- **Texture failures were swallowed silently** by a bare `except: pass` around the texture state.
- Exporting a texture pack wrote the same UV guide image twice, under two names.

- **Every mesh operation re-sent the whole texture set.** A repair, a reduce, an undo or even a
  rotate re-encoded all six maps to base64 and shipped them to the interface: 375 ms and 12.8 MB
  each time, for data that had not changed. Results now carry a version number and a list of
  channels; the maps are fetched only when that version moves. Ten operations in a row went from
  about 3.7 seconds of encoding to 12 milliseconds.
- **The MCP server returned megabytes of texture data to assistants.** `_strip()` dropped the binary
  mesh preview but not the textures, so a single `repair` on a textured model returned 9.27 MB —
  enough to swamp a context window. Tool results are now under a kilobyte.
- **Texture seams could show dark fringes.** The gutters between UV islands were left empty, so GPU
  filtering and mipmapping blended that emptiness into the edge of every island. Exported texture
  packs, baked GLBs and textured OBJ/glTF exports now have their gutters padded. The maps held in
  memory are untouched — padding is applied to copies on the way out.
- **Generated normal maps had a false ridge along all four borders.** The gradient pass assumed the
  source image tiled, so it read the opposite edge as if it were adjacent. It no longer does unless
  you say the image tiles.

- **Loading a dense FBX took minutes.** A 225 MB, 5-million-triangle model effectively hung: it
  loaded in about 27 seconds, of which ten minutes and counting were spent re-projecting texture
  coordinates that were already correct. Separating a multi-body model renumbers its faces, and the
  commit step responded by projecting twenty million points onto a five-million-face surface to
  recover a mapping it could have simply permuted. It now carries the permutation through and
  reindexes, which is exact and instant.
- **Row-wise de-duplication was the next bottleneck.** Deciding which edges are open, which faces
  are duplicates and which corners can be welded all reduce to "which rows of this array are equal",
  and `numpy.unique(axis=0)` answers that by sorting each row as a block of bytes. Packing each row
  into a single 64-bit key instead is exact and several times quicker: building the viewport vertex
  buffer went from 5.6 s to 1.8 s, and the diagnostics pass from 10.1 s to 7 s on the same model.
  Where the values will not fit in a key, the original path still runs.
- **The loader paid for a summary the application discards.** `load_model()` measured
  watertightness, volume and area on every load — three seconds on a dense model — and the desktop
  app threw the result away before running the full diagnostics. It is now optional.
- The FBX index buffers are read with `np.fromiter`, and duplicate faces found with packed keys
  rather than trimesh's row hash, together about a second and a half on a five-million-face model.
- Hole counting no longer re-derives the open edges the diagnostics pass had already found.
- **A failed file dialog was reported as if a file had been chosen.** The dialog methods return a
  path, and the interface treats the return value as one. Wrapping them in the error decorator made
  them answer with `{success: false, ...}` on failure — a truthy object that was then handed to the
  loader as a path, so a dialog that could not open surfaced as *"path.split is not a function"*.
  They now return an empty string in every failure case and log the real reason.
- **Several viewport controls stopped repainting.** Moving to on-demand rendering saved the CPU an
  idle 60 fps, but six methods that change the scene never asked for a frame: the light sliders, the
  diagnostic locator, the piece highlighting, the displacement slider, the environment and the
  preset views all appeared dead until the camera happened to move. Every scene-mutating method now
  invalidates, and a test enumerates them so the next one cannot be forgotten.
- **FBX polygons are triangulated with array arithmetic** rather than a Python loop over every
  corner, and are covered by tests against a reference implementation for triangles, quads, n-gons
  and meshes that mix them.
- The UV worker no longer asks xatlas to pack an empty set, which wrote a complaint to a native
  stderr the parent could not catch.

- **Textures from Meshy and Hi3D models loaded flat.** Those generators embed a 2x2 placeholder in
  the FBX material and ship the real 2048px maps as files beside it. Treating the material as
  authoritative — correct in general — meant the placeholder won, so a fully textured model appeared
  untextured. Placeholders are now ignored in favour of the real artwork. On a Meshy export that is
  the difference between one 2x2 image and four 2048px maps.
- **Smart retopology could take ten minutes and then close the application.** QuadriFlow can abort
  inside Eigen on a mesh it dislikes, which in-process ends Meshwright mid-operation. It now runs in
  a child process with a two-minute budget per piece; a crash or a stall falls through to uniform
  remeshing, and the log says which engine did the work.
- **Preparing a dense piece for smart retopology took 73 seconds.** Decimating five million faces to
  two hundred thousand went straight to MeshLab's topology-preserving collapse. Doing it in two
  steps — fast-simplification for the bulk, MeshFix to sew the surface closed — takes 27 seconds end
  to end instead of 82, and the finished retopology deviated 4.95% from the original rather than
  9.68%. MeshLab still runs when that chain cannot produce a manifold.
- **The 2D UV view was unreadable on a dense model.** It drew one triangle in every few hundred,
  which is a field of specks rather than a wireframe. It now draws the island outlines — the seams
  and open edges that define the layout — and says that is what it is doing.
- **The diagnostics crashed on a model with duplicate faces.** A refactor kept the totals and dropped
  the masks the issue locations are built from, so clicking "Duplicate faces" raised a NameError.

### Added
- **Viewport detail.** A model too dense to draw quickly is shown simplified, with a slider in the
  viewport toolbar to raise it to the full mesh and a message saying what is on screen. It is the
  picture only: diagnostics, repair, reduce, retopology and export always use every triangle. A
  five-million-triangle model's viewport payload drops from 148 MB to 27 MB.
- **Image tiles seamlessly** option for PBR generation: blends the source edges and wraps the
  surface gradients, for repeating materials.
- **Displace** slider and a **Height** viewport channel, so the generated height map can be seen and
  used instead of only exported.
- Unwrapping now reports what it actually produced — islands, seam edges, atlas size and whether the
  texture density came out even — instead of a chart count that was really the mesh's body count.
- **New** button in the top bar (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>) and <kbd>Delete</kbd> both close the
  model and empty the workspace — mesh, undo history, autosave snapshot and textures — after a
  confirmation. <kbd>Delete</kbd> still removes ticked pieces when the Separate pieces panel has a
  selection.
- OBJ, GLB and glTF exports now carry the model's UV coordinates and PBR maps. STL, PLY, OFF and 3MF
  cannot store them and are unchanged.
- `rtree` is now a required package. It bundles libspatialindex, installs as a pure wheel on every
  supported Python, and provides the AABB queries behind the exact UV transfer. Without it the
  transfer falls back to a slower KD-tree candidate search rather than failing.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **The installer said Python was missing when it was not — and stopped when it really was.**
  Windows ships a placeholder `python.exe` (App Execution Alias) that prints *"Python was not
  found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store"* and exits with an error.
  `install.ps1` ran `python --version` inside a `try/catch`, which never sees a native exit code,
  so it printed `[OK] Detected`, kept going, and failed one step later with
  `[ERROR] Could not create the virtual environment.` The installer now *probes* candidates by
  running them — the py launcher, every `python`/`python3` on `PATH`, the registry entries written
  by the python.org installer, and the usual install folders including conda and uv — keeps only
  real 64-bit interpreters that have `venv` and `ensurepip`, prefers the tested 3.10–3.13 series,
  and when nothing is usable explains how to install Python and how to switch the placeholder off.
- **One missing wheel aborted the whole installation.** `pip install -r requirements.txt` is
  all-or-nothing, and several dependencies are compiled extensions with no build for the newest
  Python for months after its release (`ufbx` has none for 3.13/3.14 and falls back to a source
  build that needs Visual C++). Required packages now live in `requirements.txt` — all of them
  pure-wheel installs — and the mesh engines moved to `requirements-optional.txt`, which the
  installer installs **one at a time**, keeping going and reporting what it skipped.
- **Exported models could slice as a thin, hollow shell.** An open surface has no inside, so a
  slicer prints it as a single-wall shell with no infill. Export now measures the result and warns
  on screen when the file is not a closed solid, when it encloses no volume, or when its walls
  average under 1.2 mm; inside-out meshes are turned the right way out on the way to the file.

### Added
- **Load demo model.** Meshwright ships no 3D models and several people expected one to come with
  it. The empty viewport now says so and offers a built-in test object, built in memory: a sphere
  with a hole, a patch of flipped faces and a loose second piece — Repair takes it to watertight.
- `install.bat -Check` reports every Python on the machine and every engine in the environment
  without changing anything, and every run writes `install-log.txt` for support.
- `install.bat -Recreate`, `-NoOptional` and `-Python <path>`, plus `scripts/check_install.py`,
  which prints exactly which engines a copy has.
- The installer refuses to run from inside a downloaded ZIP or a folder it cannot write to, and
  explains what to do instead; `start.bat` says to run `install.bat` first instead of falling back
  to a system Python that may not exist.

### Changed
- Export offers STL, OBJ, PLY, OFF, GLB, glTF and 3MF, and names files
  `<original>-GS-<timestamp>-fixed.<ext>`.
- `numpy` upper bound raised to `<2.6`.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- **The installer could break other Python projects.** `requirements.txt` used unbounded version
  ranges, so `pip install -r requirements.txt` on a shared interpreter upgraded numpy to the latest
  release and broke unrelated packages that pin it (numba, pyarrow and friends). Every dependency
  now has an upper bound (`numpy>=1.26,<2.4`), and the installer creates an isolated `.venv` inside
  the project folder by default. `start.bat`, `start.ps1` and the new `run-mcp.bat` use it
  automatically; `install.ps1 -Global` opts back into a system-wide install.

### Added
- `requirements-dev.txt` for the test and lint tooling.
- `run-mcp.bat` to start the MCP server from the project environment.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- **Sliver repair tore the mesh.** Edge collapses and flips were applied without checking whether
  they were topologically valid, so fixing slivers on a closed model could open holes and create
  non-manifold edges — which the safety guard then (correctly) rejected, making the button look
  broken. Collapses now require the **link condition** and flips require that the replacement edge
  does not already exist; a pass that would still worsen the topology is discarded. On a
  1,994,490-face miniature: 186 slivers → 3, mesh stays watertight, and the 3 it refuses to touch
  are reported instead of silently forced.
- Shell colours were washed out by the key light on large models; the palette is now deeper and the
  material less reflective.

### Added
- **Progress notifications.** Long operations report the face count and an estimated duration before
  starting, show a live elapsed timer and progress bar in the bottom-right of the workspace, and
  report the real elapsed time when they finish. Toasts can be dismissed or left to fade.
- Result toasts for repair, sliver fixing and reduction, including surface deviation, and a toast
  when a change is rejected by the safety guard.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-21

### Added
- **Smart retopology** — QuadriFlow (BSD-3) rebuilds a model as clean, curvature-aligned quads;
  three reduction engines (smart retopo / decimate / uniform) with an absolute face target,
  low-poly presets and measured surface deviation in millimetres.
- **MCP server** (`mcp_server.py`) exposing 15 tools over stdio, plus a `meshwright://report` resource.
- **Service layer** (`engine.service.MeshService`) shared by the desktop app, MCP and Python callers.
- **Undo / redo** with numbered states, plus a full keyboard shortcut set and an in-app help dialog.
- **Crash recovery** — every accepted state is snapshotted in a background thread and offered for
  recovery if the app does not exit cleanly.
- **Safety guard** — a change that would add critical problems or discard most of the geometry is
  rejected, keeping the previous state, with an explicit "apply anyway".
- **Issue locations** — click any diagnostic to fly to it; exact spots plus a general-area marker.
- **About panel** listing every engine with its installed version.
- **Sliver repair** — needle triangles collapsed, cap triangles flipped into larger neighbours.
- **JSON report** export of diagnostics and the full operation history.
- MeshFix added to the repair pipeline; scikit-image enables the voxel remesh fallback.
- Input validation layer (`engine.validation`) applied to every public call.

### Fixed
- Retopology could return a mesh with new holes and split shells on topologically complex models;
  every piece is now verified and repaired with MeshFix, or falls back to another engine.
- Simplify was silently rejected by the safety guard on already-imperfect meshes and appeared to do nothing.
- Issue highlights were offset from the model, and did not follow the model after rotation.
- Rotation re-uploaded the whole mesh on every step; it is now instant with a background sync.
- Drag-and-drop reported "full path unavailable"; paths now come from the Python-side drop handler.
- The Open dialog crashed on an invalid file-type filter label.
- A Unicode console write could abort an operation on Windows.
- A failing logger could abort a mesh operation.
- Voxel remesh silently did nothing when scikit-image was missing.

### Changed
- Rebuilt UI: minimal dark theme, resizable panel, activity console, XYZ compass, preset views,
  rotation gizmo, shell colour-coding that no longer clashes with selection or highlight colours.
- trimesh upgraded to 5.0; Three.js vendored locally so the app works offline.
- Renamed to **Meshwright** with a new application icon and Geekatplay Studio branding.

## [1.0.0]
- Initial release: load, analyse, repair, decimate and export STL.
